            <h1>Enhancing File Sharing and Data Management Capabilities at Batangas State University - Alangilan Faculty Through a Distributed File System</h1>
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>The study aims to enhance file sharing and data management capabilities at Batangas State University - Alangilan Faculty through a Distributed 
                File System (DFS). The project involves in creating a logical design for file distribution across shared folders and mapping the virtual DFS 
                path to the physical location of files using Django Framework. The web application acts as a gateway for accessing files in the DFS, providing 
                the user file management, shared file management, search function, and admin tracking. The DFS Namespace configuration allows the web application 
                to store files and access multiple storage. Furthermore, a database allows the web application administrator to track details, including users, 
                file details, and shared files details. The project successfully achieved its research objectives and provided a robust platform for file handling. 
                The Django framework maps the DFS paths to their physical locations, demonstrating the practical benefits of combining distributed computing with 
                web technologies. The design project sets a precedent for future endeavors in distributed file systems and web application integration, offering a 
                scalable methodology for data management. This innovative method creates new opportunities for software development and data processing innovation 
                while also enhancing the capabilities of existing technologies.</p>
